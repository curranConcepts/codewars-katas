  Title:
    What's a Perfect Power anyway?

  Description:
    A perfect power is a classification of positive integers:

    In mathematics, a perfect power is a positive integer that can be expressed as an integer power of another positive integer. More formally, n is a perfect power if there exist natural numbers m > 1, and k > 1 such that mk = n.
    Your task is to check wheter a given integer is a perfect power. If it is a perfect power, return a pair m and k with mk = n as a proof. Otherwise return Nothing, Nil, null, NULL, None or your language's equivalent.

  Notes:
   For a perfect power, there might be several pairs.
   For example 81 = 3^4 = 9^2, so (3,4) and (9,2) are valid solutions.
   However, the tests take care of this, so if a number is a perfect power, return any pair that proves it.
