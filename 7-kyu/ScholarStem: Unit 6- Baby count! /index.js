  Title:
    ScholarStem: Unit 6- Baby count!

  Description:
    A local birthing center is interested in names!
    They have arrays of all the baby names they see each year, but the lists are sooo long!

    They donâ€™t know how to calculate how many times one name is used.
    Given an array of names and a specific name string, return the number of times that specific name appears in the array.

  Examples:
    countName( ["Tom","Bob","Harry","Bob"] , "Bob") //should return 2, since "Bob" shows up 2 times in the array

// Long Solution
/*
const countName = (array, nameToFind) => array.reduce((acc, name) => (name === nameToFind ? acc + 1 : acc), 0)
*/

// Short Solution
const countName = (array, nameToFind) => array.filter((name) => nameToFind === name).length

// Function Export
module.exports = countName
